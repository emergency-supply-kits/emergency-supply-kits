								<h2 class="major">About Us</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="aboutMe.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Our names are Eesha Agrahar and Roschelle D’souza and we are freshmen at Tompkins High School in Katy, Texas. We are part of a club called Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), and as a part of this club, are participating in the Community Service Project. We are state winners and are now going to be proudly representing Texas at nationals.</p>
						        <p>For our state project, we strove to help children all around the world escape hunger. We did this by selling 370 cookies, raising 470 dollars, and donating all revenue to Feed the Hunger, an organization that provides meals to children in need. We also participated in a packathon, where we were able to pack 7,200 meals ourselves for these children. 
								</p>
								<p>This state project certainly impacted the lives of many, but for our national project, our hope is work locally and make personal connections to families that need help. View our Mission page for more details on our new project.

								<h2 class="major">Our Mission</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="missionUpdate.jpg" alt="mission update" /></span>
								<p>Our mission is to make and distribute emergency supply kits to low-income families in the Fort Bend County area. Since we live in a hurricane-prone region, we prepare for hurricane season every year, and we have been aware of the threat of natural disasters throughout our lives. We also know that our families are blessed to have access to resources that have helped us overcome hardships caused by natural disasters. However, there are many families in our county without the same basic resources that we have access to. By preparing and distributing emergency supply kits, our hope is that we would be able to help these families survive when disaster strikes again.
								</p>
								<p>After going through the list provided by FEMA about supplies for disaster recovery kits, we consulted with our local fire department and then worked with social services to make the list localized towards Fort Bend County.
								</p>
								<p>We came up with this checklist:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Water Bottles</li>
									<li>Water purifying tablets</li>
									<li>First-aid kits</li>
									<li>Ready to eat food</li>
									<li>Mini flashlights
									</li>
									<li>Flashlight batteries
									</li>
									<li>Masks
									</li>
									<li>
										Sanitizers
									</li>
									<li>Mini toothpaste and toothbrushes
									</li>

								</ul>
								<p>With your donation, we’ll be able to provide more low-income families with these necessary supplies. Visit our Donations page to contribute to this cause, and visit our Learn page to educate yourself on how to be safe and ready in the case of disaster.

							    <p>It’s important to raise awareness on how to be responsible and ready for disaster. The most common natural disasters in Texas include wildfires, floods, hurricanes, severe storms, tornadoes, extreme heat, landslides, and power outages. 
								</p>
								<p>Some supplies that you should keep together in a grab-n-go kit for each of these situations are: 
									<ul>
									<li>Water (one gallon per person per day for several days, for drinking and sanitation)</li>
									<li>Food (at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food)</li>
									<li>Battery-powered or hand-crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert (to hear the instructions of local news outlets)</li>
									<li>Flashlight</li>
									<li>First aid kit </li>
									<li> batteries</li>
									<li>Whistle (to signal for help)</li>
									<li>Dust mask (to help filter contaminated air)</li>
									<li>Plastic sheeting and duct tape (to shelter in place)</li>
									<li>Moist towelettes, garbage bags, feminine hygiene products and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)</li>
									<li>Wrench or pliers (to turn off utilities)</li>
									<li>Manual can opener (for food)</li>
									<li>Local maps</li>
									<li>Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery</li>
								</ul>	
							</p> 
							
							<p>After you ensure that you have the essential items,  remember to maintain your kit so it’s ready when needed:</p>
                            <ul>
								<li>Keep canned food in a cool, dry place.</li>
                                 <li>Store boxed food in tightly closed plastic or metal containers.</li>
								 <li>Replace expired items as needed.</li>
                                 <li>Re-think your needs every year and update your kit as your family’s needs change</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Since you do not know where you will be when an emergency occurs, prepare supplies for home, work and cars.
								<br><b>Home: </b> Keep this kit in a designated place and have it ready in case you have to leave your home quickly. Make sure all family members know where the kit is kept.
								<br><b>Work: </b> Be prepared to shelter at work for at least 24 hours. Your work kit should include food, water and other necessities like medicines, as well as comfortable walking shoes, stored in a “grab and go” case.
								<br><b>Car: </b>In case you are stranded, keep a kit of emergency supplies in your car.

								<p>What do I do in case of a...</p>
								<p><b>Wildfire? </b>The most important thing to do in case of any of these natural disasters is listen to officials. If they tell you to evacuate, evacuate immediately. In case of a wildfire, report any fire you see immediately to ensure the safety of others. If you are at home, shut off your gas and check all your vents to make sure that your home is safe. Lastly, locate your emergency supply kits, because they will be helpful if things get really bad. 
									“Chubb: What to Do When a Wildfire Approaches.” Chubb in the US, www.chubb.com/us-en/individuals-families/resources/what-to-do-when-a-wildfire-approaches.html. 
									</p>
									<p><b>Flood? </b>Find safe shelter right away. Do not walk, swim or drive through floodwaters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown! Remember, just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away. Stay off bridges over fast-moving water.
										Depending on the type of flooding:
										Evacuate if told to do so. 
										Move to higher ground or a higher floor.
										Stay where you are.
										Make sure to carry your emergency supply kit with you.
										“Floods.” Floods | Ready.gov, www.ready.gov/floods. 
										</p>
									<p><b>Hurricane/Tornado? </b>Go to NOAA Weather Radio and your local news or official social media accounts for updated emergency information. Follow the instructions of state, local and tribal officials. Go to a safe shelter immediately, such as a safe room, basement, storm cellar or a small interior room on the lowest level of a sturdy building.Stay away from windows, doors, and outside walls. Do not go under an overpass or bridge. You’re safer in a low, flat location. Watch out for flying debris that can cause injury or death. Use your arms to protect your head and neck. If you can’t stay at home, make plans to go to a public shelter. Review the CDC's guidelines for going to a public disaster shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic.
											Make sure to keep your emergency supply kit with you.
											“Tornadoes.” Tornadoes | Ready.gov, www.ready.gov/tornadoes. 
											
										</p>
									<p> <b>Storm? </b>Make sure that you have a portable radio to listen to important storm updates, information, and instructions.
										Stay inside and keep away from all windows, skylights, and glass doors. Go to a safe area, such as an interior room, closet, or downstairs bathroom, and make sure not to come out of this safe spot until the threat is gone. Avoid power lines, and don’t touch anything in contact with these power lines to ensure that you don’t get shocked. Protect your home from further damage by boarding up a broken window. Keep accurate records of your expenses and save bills and receipts from your temporary repairs. Create a list of any damage caused by the storm, including a description of the item, name of the manufacturer, brand name, and age.If you think your home might be unsafe due to storm damage, contact your insurance company to discuss finding temporary accommodations.
										</p>
									<p> <b>Landslide? </b>Listen to local news stations on a battery-powered radio for warnings. Always follow the instructions from local emergency managers. Make plans to shelter with friends or family in advance so that you can evacuate to their safe location if necessary. Review your previous evacuation plan and consider alternative options to maintain social and physical distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19. During a storm that could cause a landslide, stay alert and awake. Many deaths from landslides occur while people are sleeping. Don’t cross a road with water or mud flowing or a bridge if you see a flow approaching. If you get stuck in the path of a landslide, move uphill as quickly as possible. 
										If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow or water that changes from clear to muddy, since these can be signs that a landslide is coming.
										Grab your emergency supply kit from your car and keep it with you for safety.
										“Landslides &amp; Debris Flow.” Landslides &amp; Debris Flow | Ready.gov, www.ready.gov/landslides-debris-flow. 
										</p>
									<p> <b>Power outage? </b> Keep freezers and refrigerators closed. Use a generator, but ONLY outdoors and away from windows. Do not use a gas stove or oven to heat your home. Disconnect appliances and electronics to avoid damage from electrical surges. Have alternate plans for refrigerating medicines or using power-dependent medical devices. Check with local officials about heating and cooling locations open near you.
